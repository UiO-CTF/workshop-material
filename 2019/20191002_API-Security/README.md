# API Security Workshop


## Event description
Hi everyone! It's time for some API security for beginners! *\(^_^)/*

In our workshops, we go through security issues and teach you how to hack them. We do this for two reasons; 
1. in order to get an understanding of which issues we need to prevent when building systems, 
2. get better at solving CTF challenges!

Marit and Nora from UiO-CTF says they have seen some lack in understanding of how HTTP requests works, how to send requests to an API, and also interpret the response of an HTTP request. Therefore, she wants to host a workshop going through:

- What is an API?
- What is an HTTP request?
- Different ways of sending an HTTP request
- API security

And of course we are going to have some practical challenges for you guys, as always!

You need to do the following to come prepared to the workshop:
* Download Postman (https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/). (Or any other tool doing the same, but Nora  and Marit will be demonstrating using Postman)
* (Optional) Download cURL if you have a Linux or MacOS distro.
